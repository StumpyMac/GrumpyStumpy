A dummy project to allow me to get to grips with Github without doing any damage!

Github seems to be used everywhere these days, so I though I ought to start
learning how to make good use of it (or any use at all!).

I've skimmed though the easy bits of the 'Git book', but need to practise this
stuff.

So this repository is just for me to play in. Don't expect to find anything 
remotely interesting or useful here: that's not the point. In fact, if you're 
hereat this repository you could probably be using your time more productively!

I'm also using GitHub Desktop at present, as I don't see much need for command
line stuff just ow.
